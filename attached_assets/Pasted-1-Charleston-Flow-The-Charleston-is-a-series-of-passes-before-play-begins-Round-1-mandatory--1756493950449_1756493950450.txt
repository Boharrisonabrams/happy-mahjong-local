1. Charleston Flow

The Charleston is a series of passes before play begins.

Round 1 (mandatory):

Pass 3 tiles to the right

Pass 3 tiles across

Pass 3 tiles to the left

Decision point: after Round 1, any player may call “Stop”.

If Stopped → move directly to Courtesy Pass.

If Continued → proceed to Round 2.

Round 2 (optional, if not stopped):

Pass 3 tiles to the left

Pass 3 tiles across

Pass 3 tiles to the right

Courtesy Pass (final, optional):

Across only.

Each across pair may exchange 0–3 tiles by agreement.

2. Rules for Passing

Standard passes = exactly 3 tiles.

Courtesy pass = 0–3 tiles.

No jokers may be passed (they must remain in the rack).

All players select tiles simultaneously in each phase.

Passes are resolved simultaneously: everyone gives, then everyone receives.

3. Passing Directions

Define player order clockwise: East → South → West → North → East.

Right = clockwise neighbor.

Left = counter-clockwise neighbor.

Across = the player opposite (two seats away).

4. UI / Experience Requirements

Selecting tiles to pass:

Players must be able to lift tiles above their rack to mark them as selected.

Pass button is disabled until exactly 3 are chosen (except courtesy).

Receiving tiles:

Incoming tiles appear above the rack (floating).

Player must place them into the rack before proceeding.

Allow reordering: players can slide tiles left/right or up/down to position them.

Next pass cycle:

Once placed, the player again selects 3 new tiles, lifts them above, and passes according to the current direction.

5. Control & State

Game State Machine should track:

Current pass phase (Right1, Across1, Left1, etc.).

Who has confirmed their selection.

Whether “Stop” was called.

Simultaneity:

The game collects all players’ choices first.

Only after all confirm are tiles removed and redistributed.

Error Prevention:

Disallow confirming with the wrong number of tiles.

Disallow passing jokers.

Prevent early advancement if not all players are ready.

6. Special Cases

Stop after Round 1: skip Round 2.

Courtesy Pass: must be agreed across the table; each side chooses 0–3 tiles.

If one side passes fewer than 3 in courtesy, the other side must match that number. (Some house rules vary here — confirm which you want.)
