# Vercel MCP Setup Status

## ‚úÖ What's Completed

1. **Vercel MCP Added**: Successfully configured with `claude mcp add --transport http vercel https://mcp.vercel.com`
2. **Configuration Updated**: MCP server added to `/home/bo/.claude.json`
3. **Server Status**: Vercel MCP server is configured but needs authentication

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status

```
vercel: https://mcp.vercel.com (HTTP) - ‚ö† Needs authentication
```

## üîê Authentication Required

To complete the setup and gain access to Vercel MCP tools, you need to:

### Option 1: Interactive Authentication
```bash
# Start a new Claude Code session
claude

# In the session, run the authentication command
/mcp
```

### Option 2: Manual Authentication
1. Visit your Vercel dashboard
2. Generate an authentication token
3. Configure it in the MCP settings

## üöÄ After Authentication

Once authenticated, you should have access to Vercel MCP tools such as:
- `vercel__list_projects`
- `vercel__create_project` 
- `vercel__deploy_project`
- `vercel__get_deployment_status`

## üîß Current Deployment Options

Since MCP authentication is needed, here are your current options:

### Option 1: Fixed Vercel.json Deploy
The `vercel.json` configuration has been fixed and should work now:
- **Deploy URL**: https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Boharrisonabrams/happy-mahjong-local

### Option 2: Manual GitHub Integration
1. Go to vercel.com
2. Import from Git: `https://github.com/Boharrisonabrams/happy-mahjong-local`
3. Deploy with environment variables

### Option 3: Complete MCP Authentication
1. Run `claude` to start a new session
2. Use `/mcp` to authenticate
3. Return to this session for MCP deployment

## üìù Environment Variables Needed

Don't forget to add these in Vercel dashboard:
```env
DATABASE_URL=your-neon-database-url
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
NODE_ENV=production
LOCAL_DEV_MODE=false
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Try the fixed deploy** with the updated vercel.json
2. **Or authenticate MCP** for direct deployment control
3. **Configure environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
4. **Test the deployed application**

The vercel.json conflict has been resolved, so manual deployment should work now!
